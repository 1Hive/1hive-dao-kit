# 1Hive Dao Kit
A kit to deploy a 1Hive style DAO and Docusaurus for your organization.

<br>

## Deliverables

1Hive DAO template
- [Aragon DAO template](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/templates-intro) that should be as easy to deploy as `npx create-hive-org <name>`

1Hive docs standard
- A standard framework for all the docs in this kit. This will include a doc creation guide that will help communities create new docs that are organized and informative as they extend and modify the DAO.

1Hive Kit Docusaurus
- A Docusaurus that can be easily configured with the content of any organization. Users will fork the repo and fill it with content relevant to their organization. It will also ship with docs/guides for the 1Hive DAO Kit itself, which users can keep or overwrite.
