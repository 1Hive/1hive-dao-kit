We are using github for project management, hosting, and long form discussion. Some of the repos are used primarily for development, while others are intended primarily for Github's `issues` functionality.

### Important Repos

This is where you can highlight the most important repos your project is working on.

[Important Repo 1]()
- Description of important repo 1.

[Important Repo 2]()
- Description of important repo 2.

### Common Patterns

To help new members navigate our Github organization we try and maintain consistent patterns across all of our repositories.
- include a guide to the way your organization uses GitHub here

Check out [Aragon's GitHub Guide](https://github.com/aragon/hack/blob/master/docs-internal/github-guide.md) for a great example.

### Contribution Guide

All repos should use include a Contribution Guide in the `README.md` file in the repositories root directory. This file should explain what the repo is for and how people can contribute.

### Task Bounties and Issue Tags

As discussed in the [Projects and Tasks](docs/contribute/projects-tasks) section of this guide, you can use the **Projects** app to coordinate and reward effort on specific tasks which are represented by Github issues.

Currently there is no way to view the funding status of an issue within Github, though this should be solved by a github bot in the future. For now, we expect **Curators** to manually attach the `Funded` tag to issues after they have been funded. And we expect **Workers** to assign themselves to issues after they have been assigned a task in the Aragon organization.
