This is where you can talk about how people can connect with your community. We recommend [Keybase](https://keybase.io/), but you could also use [Reddit](https://reddit.com), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/), or anything else you want. 

### Introduce yourself! 

The first thing someone should do after joining the chat is to introduce themselves. We recommend creating an onboarding guide for that here. This might include direction like: 
- Tell us about how you discovered YOUR-ORG-NAME. Were you invited by someone in the community, did you stumble upon us from somewhere else? 
- Tell us about your intentions, why did you join the chat? Are you just a curious observer or eager to work on some tasks and earn some bounties.
- Tell us about your skills and expertise, this is especially relevant if you are interested in contributing as it helps other members coordinate around who might be well suited for a task or question. 
- Tell us about your hobbies or interests, perhaps you will meet a kindred spirit. 
- Etc...

### Chat Etiquette

Always good to set expectations and provide guidelines for healthy discussions. While this doc probably isn't the best place for a CoC, a quick set of tips might go a long way. Here's what that might look like:

We love our community chat and find it incredibly helpful when coordinating with other community members, but there are many ways for chats to go wrong. Please try and adopt the following behaviors when participating in 1Hive chat.

- Always keep to the purpose of the group! Avoid sharing irrelevant messages about other topics.
- Keep conversations civil, and try and keep a positive tone.
- If you’re lurking in a group chat and ‘seeing’ every message, occasionally respond with *something*, even if its just a reaction emoji.
- Do not spam the group!

### Chat Channels
