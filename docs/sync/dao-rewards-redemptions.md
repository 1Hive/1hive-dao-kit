At any time, `Honey` can be redeemed for a proportional share of the current treasury assets using the Redemptions app. Additionally, If there is consensus among members treasury assets can also be distributed proportionally to `Honey` holders using the **Rewards** application.

Together these two mechanisms allow members to value `Honey` as a claim on the **present** and **potential future value** of the organization's assets.
