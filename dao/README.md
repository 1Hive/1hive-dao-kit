## Resources

Things that provide information on the Aragon DAO Template process (note: "dao kits" and "dao templates" refer to the same thing in this context) 
- [DAO Templates](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/templates-intro) - hack.aragon docs on DAO temmplates
- [Aragon DAO Kits](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits) - Monorepo for all Aragon made DAO Kits or templates.
- [Autark Labs TPS launcher](https://github.com/AutarkLabs/tps-launcher/) - Aragon customized onboarding wizard to launch DAOs powered by That Planning Suite (the code that creates https://rinkeby.autark.xyz/#/).
- [Aragon Architecture Guide](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/blob/architecture-guide/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Might also be useful?

Note: to run most of the examples in the repos or tutorials you'll need to install the Aragon CLI and have Aragon devchain running in the background
- make sure you have node `v10.15.3`, not `v12`
- `npm i -g @aragon/cli@5.6.2` (currently this version of the Aragon CLI works)
- `npx aragon devchain` in a separate terminal window
